# Rust Learning

This repository was created for my learning of the Rust programming language.

In this repository i will publish projects from the ["The Rust Programming Language book"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) and **my own** little projects.

## Projects

### [Hello world](https://github.com/Ladniy/rust-learning/tree/master/hello_world) and [Hello world Cargo](https://github.com/Ladniy/rust-learning/tree/master/hello_world_cargo)

First programm of everyone who starting learn any programming language.<br>
Hello world and Hello world Cargo is the same programs, just with one difference: Hello world compiled with rustc and Hello World Cargo compiled with Cargo. That's it!

### [Guessing Game](https://github.com/Ladniy/rust-learning/tree/master/guessing_game) (Rust Book project)

This is a small game that invites you to guess a number between 1 and 100.<br>
Probably, in the future, i will "upgrade" this game with a function to set custom range of numbers.

Program work

Here you can see program behavior, when user send a string (or any other type) instead of a number.<br>
This behavior have a difference from a book version.

In book version error behavior will look's like:<br>
`Please input your guess.
foo
Please input your guess.
61`

Without any message of what happened.
